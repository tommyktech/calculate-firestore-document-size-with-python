# A Tiny Python Script for Calculating Firestore Document Size

The size of a document in Firestore is restricted upto 1MB, but I can't find any official Python code for calculateing it.   
Then I developed this script based on the following official document. 

https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size


# Prerequirements
`pip install firebase-admin`  
`pip install google-cloud-firestore`


# Usage
See `calculate-document-size.py`
